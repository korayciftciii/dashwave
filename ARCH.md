# üèóÔ∏è Dashwave Architecture Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of Dashwave's architecture, technology stack, and system design patterns.

## üìä System Architecture Overview

Dashwave is built as a modern, full-stack SaaS application using a multi-tenant architecture pattern. The system is designed for scalability, security, and performance.

### High-Level Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Frontend Layer**: Next.js 14 with App Router, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Authentication Layer**: Clerk authentication with JWT tokens
- **Backend Layer**: API routes, Prisma ORM, email services
- **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL database with Neon.tech

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Frontend Technologies
- **[Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/)** - React framework with App Router
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **[Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/)** - Unstyled, accessible components
- **[Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)** - Icon library

### Backend Technologies
- **[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)** - Next-generation ORM
- **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)** - Relational database
- **[Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/)** - Email service

### Authentication & Security
- **[Clerk](https://clerk.com/)** - Authentication platform
- **Role-Based Access Control** - Custom authorization system

### Infrastructure & Deployment
- **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** - Deployment platform
- **[Neon.tech](https://neon.tech/)** - Serverless PostgreSQL

## üè¢ Multi-Tenant Architecture

### Tenant Isolation Strategy

Dashwave implements a **shared database, shared schema** multi-tenancy model with the following characteristics:

- **Team-based isolation**: Each team acts as a tenant with isolated data
- **Row-level security**: Database queries filtered by team membership
- **API-level authorization**: Middleware ensures users only access their team's data

### Data Isolation
- Teams cannot access other teams' data
- Users can belong to multiple teams
- Role-based permissions within each team

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Core Entities

1. **User** - User accounts linked to Clerk authentication
2. **Team** - Multi-tenant team workspaces
3. **TeamMember** - Team membership with roles and permissions
4. **Project** - Projects within teams
5. **Task** - Tasks within projects with assignments

### Role System
- **OWNER** - Full access, can transfer ownership
- **MANAGER** - Can manage team, projects, and tasks
- **WRITER** - Can create projects and tasks
- **MEMBER** - Can create tasks and participate
- **VIEWER** - Read-only access

### Permissions
- `canManageTeam` - Add/remove members, change roles
- `canManageProjects` - Create/delete projects
- `canManageTasks` - Create/assign tasks
- `canViewAll` - View all team content

## üîê Security Architecture

### Authentication Flow
1. User signs in through Clerk
2. Clerk issues JWT token
3. Middleware validates token on protected routes
4. User context available throughout application

### Authorization System
- **Role-based permissions** for each team
- **Custom role titles** while maintaining permissions
- **Granular permission flags** for fine-tuned access control

## üìß Email System

### SMTP Configuration
- **Gmail SMTP** integration for reliable email delivery
- **HTML email templates** with branding
- **Personalized content** based on user and action context

### Email Triggers
- Task assignments
- Team invitations
- Welcome messages
- Project notifications

## üé® Frontend Architecture

### Component Structure
- **Layout components** for consistent UI structure
- **Page components** for route-specific content
- **Feature components** for business logic
- **UI components** for reusable interface elements

### State Management
- **React state** for local component state
- **URL state** for navigation and filtering
- **Server state** via API calls and caching
- **Authentication state** through Clerk context

## üîÑ API Architecture

### RESTful API Design
- **Resource-based URLs** (`/api/teams`, `/api/projects`, `/api/tasks`)
- **HTTP methods** for CRUD operations
- **Consistent response formats** with proper error handling
- **Input validation** and sanitization

### Middleware Pipeline
1. **Authentication** - Verify user identity
2. **Authorization** - Check team membership and permissions
3. **Validation** - Validate request data
4. **Rate limiting** - Prevent abuse

## üöÄ Performance Optimization

### Frontend Optimizations
- **Code splitting** for reduced bundle sizes
- **Image optimization** with Next.js Image component
- **Static generation** for public pages
- **Client-side caching** for API responses

### Backend Optimizations
- **Database indexing** for query performance
- **Connection pooling** for database efficiency
- **Query optimization** with Prisma

### Infrastructure Optimizations
- **CDN delivery** through Vercel
- **Edge functions** for global performance
- **Automatic scaling** based on demand

## üîß Development Workflow

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **ESLint** for code linting
- **Prettier** for code formatting
- **Git hooks** for automated checks

### CI/CD Pipeline
1. Code commit triggers build
2. Automated testing and linting
3. Build verification
4. Automatic deployment to Vercel

## üìä Monitoring & Observability

### Error Tracking
- Client-side error monitoring
- Server-side error logging
- Performance metrics collection

### User Analytics
- Feature usage tracking
- User engagement metrics
- Conversion funnel analysis

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Real-time collaboration** with WebSockets
2. **Advanced analytics** and reporting
3. **API rate limiting** and usage analytics
4. **Mobile applications** with React Native
5. **AI-powered insights** for project management

### Scalability Improvements
1. **Microservices architecture** for complex features
2. **Event-driven architecture** with message queues
3. **Advanced caching** with Redis
4. **Database sharding** for large-scale deployment

## üìã Deployment Architecture

### Production Environment
- **Vercel hosting** for frontend and API routes
- **Neon.tech PostgreSQL** for database
- **Gmail SMTP** for email delivery
- **Clerk** for authentication services

### Environment Configuration
- **Environment variables** for sensitive configuration
- **Separate staging and production** environments
- **Automated backups** and disaster recovery
